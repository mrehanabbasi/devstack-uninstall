# devstack-uninstall
Uninstall Script for Devstack.


## Execution
**Note**:
This script assumes that Devstack is installed via the offical Devstack installation guide:
https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/


The `devstack-clean.sh` file is to be run as `root` or with a user with sudo privileges other than `stack`. This script is for Debian based systems only. In case of using some other distribution, please use your distribution's package installer instead of apt.
